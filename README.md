# OS-Monitor-Coffee-Machine
A program that utilizes a monitor to allow concurrent coffee dispensing.

The coffee machine can produce either hot or cold coffee.

The coffee machine has two dispensers.

The coffee machine can operate in either hot mode or cold mode. Hence it can't dispense hot coffee and cold coffee simultaneously. 

Clients are divided into hot clients (who want hot coffee), and cold clients (who want cold coffee).

A queue of clients are to be served, including hot clients and cold clients.

Each client utilizes one dispenser.

Each client can choose the duration length they want their coffee to brew for.

A monitor is utilized to ensure correct concurrent usage of both dispensers, in either hot mode or cold mode.
